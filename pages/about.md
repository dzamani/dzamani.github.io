<h1 id="about-title">Hi! I'm {{ site.author.name }}</h1>
<br />
Curious and passionate game programmer, I studied in France :fr: and am now living in Montreal :canada: as a **Software Developer at Unity Technologies**. <br /><br />

If I had to describe what I strive to achieve, when I work, it would be **100% efficiency**.

What I mean is that I want to reduce as much as possible things that could slow down my team and I. In order to get the best results we should have the best environment and the fewest interferences possible to be able to fully focus on our task at hand. I go more in-depth into that mindset in this blogpost: [[100% efficiency]](/blog/efficiency).

I enjoy my work the most when I develop and design complex systems or when I create tools to develop games faster. Trying to find the perfect balance between time spent on features and time spent on optimizations is the other aspect of game development that keeps me engaged. <br /><br />
Constantly looking for new challenges to face, I am now living my childhood dream of working in the games industry. In my day-to-day work, I am constantly trying to improve my skills and knowledge as there is always something new to learn and I always feel accomplished when building upon previous experiences, even the "bad" ones! <br /><br />

I've worked on several diverse projects while I was at **iLLOGIKA** and **C4M**, from mobile games to consoles, 2D to 3D, and even multiplayer games, I've managed to gain experience on a large variety of games.

Even at home, I love tinkering on my personal projects, craving for even more challenges like designing tools/tech and solving problems that would further improve my knowledge as a Game Developer. <br /><br />

Would it be at my 24h/7 school or 2 independent game studios where I worked, I often had to deal with multiple projects at the same time and short deadlines. From that, I've learned to handle stress and quickly adapt to use unknown technologies or frameworks. It has given me the ability to work efficiently when put in front of a project or feature that I haven't seen before. <br /><br />
